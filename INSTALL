Install instruction

1. Set up JAVA_HOME to point to the JDK installation.
   E.g.
   % export JAVA_HOME=/opt/jdk1.7.0_09

2. Install the dependencies.
   * Install colt as "colt" next to the jcp directory to support the
     preset class path.
   * Install org.JSON as "JSON/json.jar" next to the jcp directory to
     support the preset class path.
   * Install the Java port of libsvm as "libsvm-java/libsvm.jar" next
     to the jcp directory to support the preset class path.
   * Install liblinear-java as "liblinear-java/liblinear-java.jar" next
     to the jcp directory to support the preset class path.
   * Install OpenCV. OpenCV might be available as a binary package.
     The OpenCV Core and ML modules and the Java bindings (jni) are required.
     To build the JNI binding the option 'build shared libs' MUST be set to NO.
     Use a recent Cmake.
     Set up OCVJARDIR to point to the directory with the OpenCV Java binding.
     E.g.
     % export OCVJARDIR=/usr/share/OpenCV/java/
   * Install the C/C++ version of libsvm. Copy libsvm.so into jcp/lib.

3. Set up LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include jcp/lib and OpenCV's library directory
   and the directory where its Java binding (jni) reside.
   E.g.
   % export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/projects/BOEL-KK-2013-2015/src/jcp/lib/:/usr/lib/jni

4. Build jcp.
   % ant -DocvJarDir=$OCVJARDIR all

5. Include jcp/build/jar/jcp.jar and the colt, JSON, Java libsvm, liblinear
   and the OpenCV jars in the Java class path.
   The jcp_train.sh and jcp_predict.sh scripts do this for the default
   directory layout.
   E.g.
   % ./jcp_train.sh -h
   % ./jcp_predict.sh -h

6. Using the bash front-end scripts a model can be created and saved using
   % ./jcp_train.sh -m mnist_576_rbf_8vr.model ../pisvm-datasets/mnist_train_576_rbf_8vr.dat

   And tested using
   % ./jcp_predict.sh -m mnist_576_rbf_8vr.model ../pisvm-datasets/mnist_test_576_rbf_8vr.dat

   Or just created and tested on a split of one data set without saving
   the model:
   % ./jcp_train.sh -v ../pisvm-datasets/mnist_train_576_rbf_8vr.dat
