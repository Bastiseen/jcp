Install instruction

1. Install colt and libsvm next to the jcp directory.

2. Build libsvm. Copy libsvm.so into jcp/lib

3. Set up LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include jcp/lib.
   E.g.
   % export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/Work/projects/BOEL-KK-2013-2015/src/jcp/lib/

4. Set up JDKDIR to point to the JDK installation.
   E.g.
   % export JDKDIR=/opt/jdk1.7.0_09

5. Build jcp.
   % ant all

6. Include colt.jar and jcp/build/jar/jcp.jar in the Java class path.
   The jcp_train.sh script does this for the default directory layout.
   E.g.
   % ./jcp_train.sh <libsvm style data set file>
   Or without the shell script
   % java -classpath 'build/jar/jcp.jar:../colt/lib/colt.jar:../colt/lib/concurrent.jar' jcp.cli.jcp_train <libsvm style data set file>
