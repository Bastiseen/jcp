JCP - Java Conformal Predictors
-------------------------------

TODO
* Verify the computation of p-values.
* Add an option to print the data set labels in the used order to the CLI tools.
* Add class conditional conformal classification.
* Add/integrate inductive conformal regression.
* More non-conformity functions.
* Proper support for multi-class classification.
* Framework for predictive performance metrics.
* Add support for cross-validation.
* Improve memory utilization for TCP
  * Small pool of (n+1)-sized training sets for use by worker threads.
  * Specialized matrix API to share training instances between training set
    copies when that is possible.

KNOWN BUGS
* Most parts only marginally tested -> more bugs to come..
* Memory leaks in the JCP code for matrix manipulation in the libsvm binding.
  -> TCC, in particular, might run out of memory.
* Memory leaks in OpenCV code for matrix manipulation in the OpenCV bindings.
  -> TCC, in particular, might run out of memory.
* Saved TCC models include the training set in a rather space inefficient
  encoding.
